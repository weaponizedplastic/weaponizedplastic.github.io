# About Weaponized Plastic Fighting League

The rules are pretty simple: build small fighting robots primarily from 3d printed
parts. Fabrication is easier, and the damage to our electronics and batteries is
minimized. Back in 2015, we started running these events at Fetch Robotics - a few
videos are posted below.

After a many year hiatus, we're building a new arena. We'll be hosting a first
event in central New Hampshire (about an hour north of Boston) on June 28. If you're
in the area and interested in competing please send an email to
weaponizedplastic@gmail.com.
