# Overview

This is a brief tutorial on how to build a robot that meets the 2026 Weaponized Plastic rules.
The tutorial walks through the components used, and why they were selected.
A full Bill of Materials (BOM) is available at the end of the tutorial for convenience.

# Drive Motors and Wheels

Our basic robot, like most fighting robots, is going to use differential drive.
This configuration uses two drive motors - when the motors are moving in the
same direction at the same speed, the robot will go forward or backwards in a
straight line. When the two motors are moving at different speeds or in different
directions, the robot will turn.

Many of the robots we built last year used very cheap (~$10) 20mm diameter gear
motors. These were an unmitigated disaster - almost every one had a gearbox failure,
with many of them literally exploding into dozens of pieces.

The *Max Brushed - Beetleweight* planetary gearmotors from
[Repeat Robotics](https://repeat-robotics.com/collections/drive-motors/products/repeat-max-brushed)
were a significant step up for reliability.
For our differential drive robot, we will need two of these motors, at a cost of $30 each.

There are numerous options for wheels. Some competitors prefer soft foam aircraft wheels,
but our tutorial robot will use a harder design from BaneBots. These wheels may not have
as much traction as the softer foam wheels, but they will last a long time. The
[BaneBots Wheels](https://banebots.com/t61p-242bp/) also need a
[BaneBots Hub]().
Since our motor has a 6mm shaft, that is the hub size we need.

NOTE: the wheels come in a variety of colors, which indicate the durometer (how hard the
robot is). You can feel free to select a different color, we've merely linked the softest,
grippiest version here.

# Weapon Drive

One of the challenges of building a 1Kg fighting robot is the overall weight budget.
Heavier weapon motors will spin up faster and impact your opponent more powerfully,
but the required components to build a functional robot already consume a good portion
of the weight budget.

Last year we had good success with a number of different weapon designs all using the same
[27mm diameter brushless motor](https://www.amazon.com/FEICHAO-Brushless-Aircraft-Multi-Copter-Outrunner/dp/B08DLR79HF).
These come in a variety of different speeds, denoted by a higher "KV" value. For this
tutorial we are using an 1800KV speed motor.

Our tutorial robot uses a vertical spinner, which we will design in the *3D Printed Parts*
section below.

# Battery and Charger

There are numerous very-cheap batteries out there. They can easily explode.
So we're going to recommend a name brand battery with some built-in added protections to
avoid overdischarge, etc.
Be sure to fully read the manual that comes with any battery or charger!

Spektrum batteries have some built-in intelligence, but require a Spektrum-branded charger.
Our tutorial bot uses an 11.1V battery to take full advantage of our drive motors, but some
robots may choose to use lower voltage 7.4V batteries. The 1300mAh rating tells us how much
energy the battery contains when fully charged. Higher numbers would provide longer runtime,
but 1300mAh should be more than enough for even several matches, and saves on weight when
compared with larger batteries.

NOTE: Spektrum batteries come with several different sizes of connector - be sure to get the
IC3 connector version. The smaller IC2 connector is a pain to deal with.

You'll also need a matching pigtail to connect the robot to the battery, and a power switch.
Both components are called out in the BOM below. The power switch we use allows the robot
to be turned on and off with a 3/32" hex driver, meaning that we can't accidently hit the
switch and be turned off during a match.

The Spektrum S100 charger is an inexpensive way to charge your battery. It uses a USB-C
connector and many of you will already have a high wattage USB-C power supply from a laptop
or tablet - if not, this is still the cheapest smart charger even with the added cost of a
USB-C power supply.

# Radios and Electronics

We'll need three pieces of electronics to control our robot:

 1. Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) for the drive motors.
 2. Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) for the weapon motor.
 3. Radio with receiver to command the robot.

While you could use two separate motor controllers for the drive motors, it is
preferable to use a dual motor controller that mixes the two channels together.
We had good results with the
[$17 FPVKing controller](https://www.amazon.com/FPVKing-Bidirectional-Brushed-2S-3S-Control/dp/B081LBL42J)
at the 2025 competition.

The weapon motor is brushless, and so it requires a brushless motor controller.
[This inexpensive one](https://www.amazon.com/Flycolor-Electric-Controller-Airplane-Brushless/dp/B0C2Z15C2B)
works well with the chosen weapon motor.

As long as your drive motor ESC can handle the mixing of the two motor channels like
our recommended one, you only need a very basic transmitter radio. The
[FLYSKY FS-i6x](https://www.amazon.com/FLYSKY-Transmitter-Controller-Receiver-Upgrade/dp/B07Z8VCB45)
is a very inexpensive option that was well tested at our 2025 event.
